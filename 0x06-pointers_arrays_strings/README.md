# 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings
## 0-strcat.c
### Write a function that concatenates two strings

    This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
    Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest

## 1-strncat.c
### Write a function that concatenates two strings

    The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
        it will use at most n bytes from src; and
        src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
    Return a pointer to the resulting string dest

## 2-strncpy.c
### Write a function that copies a string

    Your function should work exactly like strncpy

## 3-strcmp.c
### Write a function that compares two strings

    Your function should work exactly like strcmp

## 4-rev_array.c
### Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

    Where n is the number of elements of the array

## 5-string_toupper.c
### Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase

## 6-cap_string.c
### Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string

## 7-leet.c
### Write a function that encodes a string into 1337

    Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
    Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
    Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
    Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
    Letters l and L should be replaced by 1

## 8-rot13.c
### Write a function that encodes a string using rot13

    You can only use if statement once in your code
    You can only use two loops in your code
    You are not allowed to use switch
    You are not allowed to use any ternary operation
    
## 100-print_number.c
### Write a function that prints an integer

    You can only use _putchar function to print
    You are not allowed to use long
    You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers
    You are not allowed to hard-code special values
    
## 101-magic.c
### Add one line to this code, so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line

    You are not allowed to use the variable a in your new line of code
    You are not allowed to modify the variable p
    You can only write one statement
    You are not allowed to use ,
    You are not allowed to code anything else than the line of expected line of code at the expected line
    Your code should be written at line 19, before the ;
    Do not remove anything from the initial code (not even the comments)
    and don’t change anything but the line of code you are adding (don’t change the spaces to tabs!)
    You are allowed to use the standard library
